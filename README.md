# NCFE3

Functional until the final step. I keep getting the message:

"Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "C:\Users\Alison\3D Objects\X.py", line 34, in <module>
    print("{0}/{1} = {2}".format(numer,denom,div_res))
NameError: name 'div_res' is not defined"

I am unsure how I have NOT defined div_res?
